# get-set

## Installation
---
* In the Finder, navigate into the `xamp/htdocs/` folder.
* Clone the git repository : `git clone https://github.com/SebGustin/get-set.git`
* Edit your hosts file to create an http protocol for your localhost, for example: `127.0.0.1 myapp.com www.myapp.com`
* Open your favorite browser (I've only test Chrome and Firefox on Mac) and go to : `myapp.com:8888/get-set/`
